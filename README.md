# PEMFCs-cold-start
This repository contains the ML model training codes and corresponding datasets mentioned in the paper "Machine Learning-Driven Cold-Start Optimization and Sensitivity Analysis for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells with Cathode Catalytic Hydrogen-oxygen Reaction", which are used to support the reproduction of the research on the cold-start performance prediction of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC).
readytime = t_preheat/ worktime = t_ecchem.
"Flowsheet_current" represents the hypothetical current value used to calculate the supply of reactants (excluding the mixed gas) for the cathode/anode reactions during the cold start process.
